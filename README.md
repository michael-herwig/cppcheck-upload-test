### GIT

Suppose you want to use a repository-specific git configuration. In that case,
you can add a new configuration file, `.gituser`, and enable _git_ to include
the repository `.gitconfig` file by running the following command within the
repository directory.

```bash
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
```
